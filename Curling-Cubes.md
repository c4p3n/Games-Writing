I Made A Thing For Ludum Dare 40
=================================

The best thing about Ludum Dare is that it ends, and ends quickly.  My biggest concern for my first ever game jam was a too large scope for a tiny time frame.  That didn't turn out to be the problem at all.  My friend and I were able to put together a simple but complete by the end of the second day.  The challenge came when we saw what we made in front of us, knew it needed more, but didn't what it needed more *of*.  

Curling Cubes is inspired by the gym games you played in school, mixed in with a little curling/air hockey.  


Our theme was "The More You Have, The Worse It Is".  On its face, that's a tough mandate.  Our minds jumped immediately to making the gameplay harder or worse based on how the player was performing.  Judging by some of the other entries, we weren't the only ones with that thought.  But that has a spiral effect if you decide to punish the player who is already struggling.  Our initial idea was to make movement worse (make slides further and turns take longer) for the player who is losing.  It turned out that it was very hard to tell that was happening unless we adjusted it so drastically that playing was almost impossible.
