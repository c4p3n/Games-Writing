Is Into The Breach a Strategy game or a Puzzle Game?  Does it matter?
========================================================================

I'm really enjoying Into the Breach.  It takes a lot of work and courage to build a game where the player can plan their next move with all the necessary information right in front of them. Player omniscience is a scary thing because it can lead to quick mastery or boredom. Apparently, it can even get a game assigned to a different genre.

In reading stories about Into The Breach I've stumbled upon more than a few comments about how this strategic Starship Troopers simulator is actually more like a kaiju-killing puzzle.  So why do people think that and why is the term "puzzle" used like a put-down?  The answer lies in the game's scope and generous UI.

This <!--link-->Gamasutra commenter argues that ITB isn't a strategy game because you know too much, and there isn't enough randomness.  The same user then comments again, putting it more succintly:

This is an agreeable line of reasoning to other commenters, but it struck me as dismissive.  I get that uncertainty adds tension and makes a game feel like it can't quite be solved the way a puzzle can.  However, removing that dice roll element does not mean automatic simplification.  Knowing how the attacks will unfold for the next move does not make your choices any easier.  There are still dozens of questions you have to ask yourself.  Can I afford to lose another city?  Is another hit to my mech worth blocking an enemy's emergence? Should I burn a single use weapon this time, or save it?  Should I let this pilot die so I don't have to read anymore of his corny dialogue?  

Hoping this was just a confined bit of genre snobbery, I went looking elsewhere. It turned out a similar sentiment had cropped up over at <!--link-->Rock Paper Shotgun.

"Mindless repetition" and "trivial variations" feels pretty harsh.  ITB has a significant number of mechs, pilots, and weapons you can combine and a good variety of enemies that will force you to change up your *strategy*.  See, I used the word.  Do I win?  In fact, the game layers on complexity as you progress with more ways to move, take, and recieve damage.  Surprises still happen because you've forgotten something that's indicated clearly on the battlefield.

I'll cap off this series of hot takes with the spiciest one of all:

Well, I'm glad they're having fun at least.

It might seem like I'm trying to keep the tainted name of "puzzle" off my precious strategy game, but I'm not.  I even agree that there is quite a bit of puzzle running through ITB, but it doesn't degrade it.  I love having all the data I need to make a plan and execute a perfect series of moves to save an dystopian island's only bar.  I love that the game fits on one screen and I don't have to send a doomed scout mech pounding off into the fog of war. 

For some, the term "puzzle" is used as a stand-in for easy or simple.  I see it as a triumph of design and focus.
