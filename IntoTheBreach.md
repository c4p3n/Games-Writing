Is Into The Breach a Strategy game or a Puzzle Game?  Does it matter?

* Gamasutra commenters arguing that elements of randomness make a game strategy.  If you know everything an enemy will do before they make their move, it's a puzzle game.

* Why does it seem like "puzzle" is used pejoratively?

* One GS user commenter suggests the game's small scope makes it feel more like a puzzle game.

* The game's number one user-defined tag on Steam is "Strategy".  "Puzzle" is 14th on the list.

* The game's Genre tags on Steam are Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy

* On GS user argues that the game doesn't force player's to take risks, making it more like a puzzle game.  Not sure this is true.  Grid Def % combined with uncertainty of enemy movements and spawns demands some risk taking.

* Many RTS games (Shadow Tactics) don't have this randomness, yet no one calls it a puzzle game.  Why?

* I think it "feels" like a puzzle game too, but I'm not sure why.


I'm really enjoying Into the Breach.  It takes a lot of work and courage to build a game where the player can plan their next move with all the necessary information right in front of them. Player omniscience is a scary thing because it can lead to quick mastery or boredom.  It can even get the game assigned to a different genre.

In reading stories about Into The Breach I've stumbled upon more than a few comments about how this strategic Starship Troopers simulator is actually more like a kaiju-killing puzzle.  So why do people think that and why does it seem that the term "puzzle" is used like a put down?  The answer appears to lie in the game's scope and generous UI.
