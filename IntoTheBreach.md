Is Into The Breach a Strategy game or a Puzzle Game?  Does it matter?
========================================================================

I'm really enjoying Into the Breach.  It takes a lot of work and courage to build a game where the player can plan their next move with all the necessary information right in front of them. Player omniscience is a scary thing because it can lead to quick mastery or boredom.  It can even get the game assigned to a different genre.

In reading stories about Into The Breach I've stumbled upon more than a few comments about how this strategic Starship Troopers simulator is actually more like a kaiju-killing puzzle.  So why do people think that and why is the term "puzzle" used like a put-down?  The answer appears to lie in the game's scope and generous UI.

This Gamasutra commenter argues that ITB isn't a strategy game because you know too much, and there isn't enough randomness.  The same user then comments again, putting it more succintly:

This is an agreeable line of reasoning to other commenters, but it struck me as dismissive.  I went looking elsewhere and found a similar sentiment over at Rock Paper Shotgun.

All this talk of "mindless repetition" and "trivial variations" feels pretty harsh.  ITB has a significant number of mechs, pilots, and weapons you can combine and a good variety of enemies that will force you to change up your *strategy*.  See, I used the word.  That settles it.

And then there's this ultra spicy take:

Well, I'm glad they're at least having fun.

The thing is, it might seem like I'm trying to keep the tainted name of "puzzle" off my precious strategy game, but I'm not.  I agree that there is quite a bit of puzzle running through ITB, but I don't see that as a bad thing.  I love having all the data I need to make a plan and execute a perfect series of moves to avoid all damage and save the cyberpunk bar.  I love that the game fits on one screen and I don't have to send a doomed scout mech pounding off into the fog of war.

To me, all this puzzle vs. strategy talk raises the question: what would tip the genre scale towards 

For some, the term "puzzle" is used as a stand-in for easy or simple.  I see it as a triumph of design and focus.
