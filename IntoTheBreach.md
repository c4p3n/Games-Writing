* Gamasutra commenters arguing that elements of randomness make a game strategy.  If you know everything an enemy will do before they make their move, it's a puzzle game.

* Why does it seem like "puzzle" is used pejoratively?

* One GS user commenter suggests the game's small scope makes it feel more like a puzzle game.

* The game's number one user-defined tag on Steam is "Strategy".  "Puzzle" is 14th on the list.

* The game's Genre tags on Steam are Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy

* On GS user argues that the game doesn't force player's to take risks, making it more like a puzzle game.  Not sure this is true.  Grid Def % combined with uncertainty of enemy movements and spawns demands some risk taking.

* Many RTS games (Shadow Tactics) don't have this randomness, yet no one calls it a puzzle game.  Why?

* I think it "feels" like a puzzle game too, but I'm not sure why.


I'm really enjoying Into the Breach.  I think it takes a lot of good design and courage to build a game where the player can plan their next move with all the information they need right in front of them.  I takes good design for obvious reasons.  It takes courage because player omniscience is scary.  It can make the game feel small in scope or boring.  Or, it could make people call your strategy game a puzzle game.

In reading stories about Into The Breach I've stumbled upon more than a few comments about how this game that bills itself as a Strategy game is actually more like a Puzzle game.  It made me wonder why people think that and why it seems that the term "puzzle" is used like a put down.
