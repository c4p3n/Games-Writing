Pyre
======

There is a moment in Pyre when Hedwyn asks you what you miss about the Commonwealth.  There are several choices, but I responded that I couldn't recall missing anything in particular.  He says he agrees, but must get there just the same...

It is revealed later that someone he loves is still there, hopefully waiting for him to return.  

The answer I chose reflected both my own thoughts and what I thought my character would say.  You begin the game by waking up in the Downside, a place where exiles are sent to serve apparently endless sentences.  You don't remember much and you're scooped up by Hedwyn and his two companions, Jodariel and Rukey.  

What follows is a series of dialogue with them and others as you make away across the Downside and compete in celestial basketball hockey with other outcasts.  And the whole time I found myself wondering what was so great about this Commonwealth that made everyone eager to return.
