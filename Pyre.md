Pyre
======

There is a moment in Pyre when Hedwyn asks you what you miss about the Commonwealth.  There are several choices, but I responded that I couldn't recall missing anything in particular.  He says he agrees, but must get there just the same...

It is revealed later that someone he loves is still there, hopefully waiting for him to return.  

The answer I chose reflected both my own thoughts and what I thought my character would say.  You begin the game by waking up in the Downside, a place where exiles are sent to serve apparently endless sentences.  You don't remember much and you're scooped up by Hedwyn and his two companions: Jodariel, an enormous and surly demon, and Rukey, the roguish but lovable dog.  
What follows is a series of dialogue with them and others as you make your way across the Downside and compete in celestial basketball with your fellow outcasts.  During the whole journey I couldn't help wondering: what was so great about this Commonwealth? 

Pyre's storytelling excels by being so full of allegory without becoming completely convoluted and still serving the mechanics of the game. Ok, so the plot complexity is kind of up to you.  There's religion, sports, authoritarian government, and probably some other stuff  I missed.  I made a point to read all the Book of Rites pages that opened up to me and, just like real world religious texts, the characters and events got pretty tough to keep straight.  But that actually made it more believable as a piece of holy scripture.  I would have liked more passages recounting the sickest dunks, but you can't have everything.

While the environment in the Downside is oppressive and dangerous, it is gorgeously so thanks to the excellent as ever art from SuperGiant.  That's another point against the Commonwealth since it sounds oppressive in the classic, less aesthetically pleasing way.  Reading is banned (that's your character's sin, by the way) and the current regime has exiled so many people that they've literally formed a sports league.
