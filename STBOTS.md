Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun
=====================================

* The modern stealth games I've played have sacrificed more and more of the satisfaction that comes from a pulling off a perfect mission.  They trade this away so that when you're caught, you can draw weapons and take down enemies in a flurry of bullets or blades.  Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun brings back that satisfaction, but makes you earn it.  

* BOTS is the only game I've played in the genre it is attempting to revive: real time tactical stealth.  It controls like an RTS or a MOBA but you are moving multiple characters through each level.
* The real time nature heightens the tension without the game having to resort to stressful timers.  Observe patrol routes and make note of hiding places.  Take all the time you want to plan your next move.  When it's time to execute, you must do so flawlessly.  

* Each mission is like a series of connected puzzle rooms.  When you spend long enough in them, you start to see some some of the solutions that the designers clearly set up.  But because you're controlling multiple characters with their own items and moves, it never seems like there's only one solution or even one "real" solution.  In most areas you have the option of taking out enemies one by one, then simply waltzing out.  Or, you can create a series of distractions and slip from cover to cover.  Both are satisfying thanks to the freedom and precision the game affords.

* Each character has a melee assassination, a way to distract enemies, and some sort of special move that fits with their character.  Different enemy types are explained well and you always know how they will react to what you do.  Some are hard to kill, while others won't react to your distractions.

* What really sets Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun apart is its UI.  In a stealth game, there is nothing more frustrating than not knowing why your cover was blown.  It's clear that the Shadow Tactics designers agree.  A huge amount of attention was paid to NPC vision, which is represented by a complex but highly readable cone.  It's green when an NPC sees nothing of interest, filling with yellow if you cross into the cone.  If the yellow reaches you, the cone turns fully red, meaning you are seen and pursued.  However, if you are in the striped line part of the cone you are visible *only* if you are standing.  You can select any visible enemy in the level and see their vision cone.  In addition you can select any area on the map and a line will be drawn to any enemy that is currently watching that location. A single button highlights every hiding place and object at least one character can use.

* These tools include highlighting hiding spots and interactable objects, an immensely useful timer showing how long since you last saved, and a system allowing you to queue up a move for each character and execute all of them at once.

* That all sounds daunting to learn, but the game teaches you all these rules and mechanics in record time.


* From Mimimi Lead Designer Moritz Wagner, explaining why only one viewcone at a time is visible:

"Information: Shadow Tactics is a game of almost perfect information. There is no fog of war, enemies don’t randomly spawn and their behavior is always predictable (as long as they aren’t actively searching for the player). Players can analyze a situation completely if they take the time to do so. Only seeing one Viewcone is the single half-hidden information when solving problems. Forcing players to memorize vision of guards beyond the first creates tension and makes the gameplay of working around Viewcones more intriguing.

Readability: A single Viewcone prevents the interface from getting cluttered and hard to read. While a huge amount of information might be okay for some players to handle, it will alienate others and look daunting on screenshots or while watching the game."
