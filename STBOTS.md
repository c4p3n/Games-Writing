The Perfect Information of Shadow Tactics
==========================================

* It seems that modern stealth games are sacrificing more and more of the satisfaction that comes from pulling off a perfect mission.  They trade this away so that when your cover is blown, you can draw weapons and take down enemies in a flurry of bullets or blades.  Shadow Tactics is not interested in giving you a "go loud" fallback.  It makes you earn everything.

BOTS is the only game I've played in the genre it is attempting to revive: real time tactical stealth.  It controls like an RTS or a MOBA but you are moving multiple characters through each level.  The fact that this is a completely new-to-me genre may be winning it some extra favor, so I want to mention that first.


* The real time nature heightens the tension without the game having to resort to stressful timers.  Observe patrol routes and make note of hiding places.  Take all the time you want to plan your next move, but when it's time to execute, you must do so flawlessly.  

* Each mission is like a series of connected puzzle rooms.  When you spend long enough in them, you start to see some some of the solutions that the designers set up.  But because you're controlling multiple characters with their own items and moves, it never seems like there is one true solution.  In most areas you have the option of taking out enemies one by one, then simply waltzing out.  Or, you can create a series of distractions and slip from cover to cover.  Both are satisfying thanks to the freedom and precision the game affords.

* Each character has a melee assassination, a way to distract enemies, and some sort of special move that fits with their character.  Different enemy types are explained well and you always know how they will react to what you do.  Some are hard to kill, while others won't react to your distractions.  Almost every level introduces some twist to the basic mechanics like leaving footprints in the snow or night missions with reduced enemy visibility.  All this keeps you from falling into a rut of distract, sneak up, assassinate.  Variety is the spice of murder.

* What really sets Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun apart is its UI.  In a stealth game, there is nothing more frustrating than not knowing why your cover was blown.  It's clear that the Shadow Tactics designers agree.  A huge amount of attention was paid to NPC vision, which is represented by a complex but highly readable cone.  It's green when an NPC sees nothing of interest, filling with yellow if you cross into the cone.  If the yellow reaches you the cone turns fully red, meaning you are seen and pursued.  However, if you can remain crouching in the striped part of the cone you stay invisible.  Select any enemy in the level and see their vision cone.  If all that's not enough, you can select any area on the map and a line will be drawn to any enemy that is currently watching that location.

I'll let Mimimi Lead Designer Moritz Wagner sum it up better than I can:

"Shadow Tactics is a game of almost perfect information. There is no fog of war, enemies don’t randomly spawn and their behavior is always predictable (as long as they aren’t actively searching for the player). Players can analyze a situation completely if they take the time to do so."

* Having this "perfect information" allows for a cool thing like Shadow Mode to exist.  This is a system allowing you to queue up a single move for multiple characters and execute all of them with a single key press. Using Shadow Mode made me feel like a tactical stealth mastermind in ways that other games don't even really attempt.  I found myself seeking out scenarios where it would be all but required. 

Having all this data means that Mimimi did not have to hold back on the difficulty, and they certainly didn't.  Enemy vision and patrols are often calibrated so that you have to patiently observe and go through quite a bit of trial and error.
