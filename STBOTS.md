Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun
=====================================

* Finally, a stealth game that makes me feel cool.  In games like Hitman and Assassin's Creed, stealth feels like a thing I can try until I get bored or my cover is blown for...some reason.  In Shogun, I am furnished with the tools to be the invisible angel of death I have always dreamed of being.

* These tools include highlighting hiding spots and interactable objects, an immensely useful timer showing how long since you last saved, and a system allowing you to queue up a move for each character and execute all of them at once.

* The real time nature heightens the tension without the game having to resort to stressful timers.  Observe patrol routes and make note of hiding places.  Take all the time you want to plan your next move.  But when you do take it, you have to execute flawlessly.  

* Each mission is like a series of connected puzzle rooms.  When you spend long enough in them, you start to see some some of the solutions that the designers clearly set up.  But because you're controlling multiple characters with their own items and moves, it never seems like there's only one solution or even one "real" solution.  In most areas you have the option of taking out enemies one by one, then simply waltzing out.  Or, you can create a series of distractions and slip from cover to cover.  Both are satisfying thanks to the freedom and precision the game affords.

* Each character has a melee assassination, a way to distract enemies, and some sort of special move that fits with their character.  Different enemy types are explained well and you always know how they will react to what you do.  Some are hard to kill, while others won't react to your distractions.

* What really sets Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun apart is its UI. I cannot overstate how much  play experience.  In a stealth game, there is nothing more frustrating than not knowing why your cover was blown.  It's clear that the Shadow Tactics designers agree.  A huge amount of attention was paid to NPC vision, which is represented by a complex but highly readable cone.  It's green when an NPC sees nothing of interest, filling with yellow if you cross into the cone.  If the yellow reaches you, the cone turns fully red, meaning you are seen and pursued.  However, if you are in the striped line part of the cone you are visible *only* if you are standing.  You can select any visible enemy in the level and see their vision cone.  In addition you can select any area on the map and a line will be drawn to any enemy that is currently watching that location. A single button highlights every hiding place and object at least one character can use.



That all sounds daunting to learn, but the game teaches you all these rules and mechanics in record time.
