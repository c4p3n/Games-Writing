You should play The Division alone.

The Division is a good loot shooter, but that's not what convinced me to buy it. It was partially the 1.8 update, which I heard improved a ton of endgame stuff. That's the boring, technical reason.

The other reason is that I could never quite keep it off my mind after playing during a free weekend. I was walking down a beautifully rendered New York street during the Christmas apocalypse. Suddenly, a desperately sad song began to float towards me from a forgotten radio. I stopped and stood between piles of trash and exhausted vehicles, listening to it reverberate off the brownstone walk-ups. It reminded me of the time my friend and I visited his sister in New York at Christmas. Our flight back home was canceled because of snow. With no plans left, we wandered around the streets of the city. There are things that other loot games do far better than The Division, but I have yet to play one that has it beat on atmosphere.

But you'd miss that if you played with others, at least in the way most groups play these games: run to objective, shoot shoot shoot, pick up gear, mark a new map icon, repeat. Something about this pace of play makes me anxious.  Don't get me wrong, it's great to catch up with friends over a hostage rescue or two.  I just don't enjoy the pressure of feeling like I have to sprint to the next mission when I really want to check out a piece of intel, or duck into an open apartment to see what was left behind.

I'm still working through story missions and I get just a little bit excited to see what the next safe house is going to look like.  The scenes that are 

When I pass two people talking I always stop to hear what their lives are like after the Dollar Flu.  Many times it's grim and despairing, but it can also be pleasantly mundane.  I find myself getting annoyed if I'm shot at during these moments.  Bullets whizzing by always cut off conversation.  What a drag.
