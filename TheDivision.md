You should play The Division alone.

The Division is a good loot shooter, but that's not what convinced me to buy it.  It was partially the 1.8 update, which I heard improved a ton of endgame stuff.  That's the boring, technical reason.  

The other reason is that I could never quite keep it off my mind after playing it during a free weekend.  I was walking down a beautifully rendered New York street during the Christmas apocalypse.  Suddenly, a desperately sad song began to float towards me from a forgotten radio.  I stopped and stood between piles of trash and exhausted vehicles, listening to it reverberate off the brownstone walk-ups.  It reminded me of the time my friend and I visited his sister in New York at Christmas.  Our flight back home was cancelled because of snow. With no plans left, we wandered around the streets of the city. There are things that other loot games do far better than The Division, but I have yet to play one that has it beat on atmosphere.
